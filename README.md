# Computer Vision Fall 2024

### Final Project Use

To use the Final Project in its entirety, you are going to need to:

- run 'git clone https://github.com/cbn0006/COMP6970.git'
- get an API key from Polygon.io
- navigate to the Data Procurement directory
- edit the getStockData.py script's main method to include your API key and run that script
- run cleaning.py (ensure the symbol is the same in both python scripts)
- run numericalDataLabeling.py (ensure original_csv is the right csv)
- run 20MinuteVisuals.py (ensuring that the right csv is being pointed to)
- run numericalAdvancedStats.py (ensuring that the right csv is being pointed to)
- run all cells in the COMP 6970 Final Project.ipynb notebook.
- You can also just load in the saved weights from the Model Weights directory to save training time because training takes roughly 2 hours
